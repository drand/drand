# Running a node with Docker

## Prerequisites
- install docker
- install docker compose (probably bundled with docker these days)
- run on linux :) (other platforms may work but YMMV)

> [!TIP]
> If you're just running a local network for testing, you probably want to use the local non-TLS image.
> For that, use ghcr.io/drand/go-drand-local instead

## Creation of a keypair

Pull the latest drand image:
```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/drand/go-drand:v2.0.7-testnet
```

Create a volume where you're going to store your keypairs and other config data
```shell
docker volume create drand
```

Next we must create a keypair and store it in the docker volume we've just created.

```shell
docker run --rm --volume drand:/data/drand ghcr.io/drand/go-drand:v2.0.7-testnet generate-keypair  --folder /data/drand/.drand --id default 0.0.0.0:8080
```

This will create a keypair for the default public listening address (0.0.0.0:8080) and store it in the `/data/drand/.drand` directory
which is mapped to the `drand` volume we created in the previous step.

You should replace `0.0.0.0:8080` with your public IP address, e.g. `pl1-rpc.drand.sh:443`, as this key is how other nodes in the network
will verify that they're talking to your node.

_Note_: access to this path should be firewalled to only allow connections from nodes in the relevant allowlist ([mainnet allowlist](https://github.com/drand/loe-mainnet-allowlist/) and [testnet allowlist](https://github.com/drand/loe-testnet-allowlist/))


## Starting drand
Finally we can start the docker container by running:
```shell
docker run --rm -d -p"8080:8080" -p"8888:8888" --name drand  --volume drand:/data/drand ghcr.io/drand/go-drand:v2.0.7-testnet start --private-listen 0.0.0.0:8080
```

If we run `docker logs -f drand`, we should be able to see that the node has started and is waiting for distributed key generation:
```
drand 1.5.2-testnet (date 06/02/2023@10:47:55, commit 7ea4a3c536bebf9436bfbc5d7b91eab9db932f53)
2023-02-08T14:08:42.622Z	INFO	0.0.0.0:8080	core/drand_daemon.go:117		{"network": "init", "insecure": true}
2023-02-08T14:08:42.643Z	INFO	0.0.0.0:8080	core/drand_daemon.go:145	DrandDaemon initialized	{"private_listen": "0.0.0.0:8080", "control_port": "8888", "public_listen": "", "folder": "/data/drand/.drand/multibeacon"}
2023-02-08T14:08:42.679Z	INFO	0.0.0.0:8080	core/drand_daemon.go:316	beacon id [default]: will run as fresh install -> expect to run DKG.
```

If we try and run `curl -v 127.0.0.1:8080/chains` we won't get anything back! The private listening port only speaks gRPC and is used when
nodes talk to one another. To expose the randomness itself, we must provide a public listening port.

Kill the container and rerun it with a command such as:
```shell
docker run --rm -d -p"8080:8080" -p"8888:8888" -p"9080:9080" --name drand  --volume drand:/data/drand ghcr.io/drand/go-drand:v2.0.7-testnet start --private-listen 0.0.0.0:8080 --public-listen 0.0.0.0:9080
```

Now if we run `curl -v 127.0.0.1:9080/chains` we should get a 200 response back and an empty list of chains.

## Running with docker compose
This dir contains a sample [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) that can be used to spin up a single node. You will still have to go through
the steps of creating a volume and keypair above to use it.

Additionally, you can easily set up a test network of three nodes by running [the start-network.sh script](./start-network.sh).
It can be torn down and cleaned up by using the [./cleanup.sh shell script](./cleanup.sh).
This manifest will spin up a network of three nodes and run an initial distributed key generation process, and they will start generating randomness beacons.

## Running with nginx
Many LoE partners like to run a reverse proxy in front of their node to easily manage TLS termination, domain names and firewalling.
In [docker-compose-nginx.yml](./docker-compose-nginx.yml) you can find a manifest for running a single drand docker container and an
nginx container to route traffic to it. Similar to the keypair, we will have to create a volume containing the nginx config (and any TLS config you wish to add).
