# Local demo of drand

This folder contains code that spins up drand nodes in the same way as in a real
world deployment. It uses real processes as drand instances and uses the CLI
commands.

## What the demo is doing

It prints out many information on its standard output so you can see what are
the steps the demo is performing:
* Setting a up a new network from scratch (running the DKG)
* Getting some beacons
* Stopping a node and checking network is still alive
* Getting node back and checking it has catched up the chain
* Doing a resharing to an extended group
* Checking the new network produces valid random beacons

## Run the demo

```
go build && ./demo -build
```

You can stop the demo by CTRL-C when ever you want.

## Fetching randomness

You can fetch randomness  by running the command written out by the demo.

## Inspecting nodes

All temporary files are written to `/tmp/drand-demo`.
You can inspect the private key, share, group and log of all nodes in
`/tmp/drand-demo/node-X/`.
