Description: Distributed Randomness Beacon Daemon
 Drand (pronounced "dee-rand") is a distributed randomness beacon daemon
 written in Golang. Linked drand nodes collectively produce publicly
 verifiable, unbiased and unpredictable random values at fixed intervals
 using bilinear pairings and threshold cryptography.
 .
 A drand network is operated by a group of organizations around the world
 that includes Cloudflare, EPFL, Kudelski Security, Protocol Labs, Celo,
 UCL, and UIUC.
 .
 This package provides the drand daemon and systemd service files.
