// Package examples provides a suite of tests showing how to use the different
// abstraction and protocols provided by the dedis/kyber library. To run the
// tests, simply do `go test -v`.
//
// dh_test shows how to perform a simple Diffie Hellman key exchange.
// enc_test shows how to perform a simple ElGamal encryption
// sig_test shows how to perform a simple Schnorr signature. Please, use this
// example as a reference to understand the abstraction only. There is a
// `sign/schnorr` package which provides Schnorr signatures functionality in a
// more secure manner.
