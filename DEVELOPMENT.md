# Quick Developer Guide

If you are reading this, it means you are about to work on the codebase.

## Getting started

### Installing dependencies

To start, you'll need to run a few commands to make sure you have the
correct development environment tools installed:
 
- `make install_deps_<os>` where `<os>` can be `linux` or `macos`. This will install the proto compiler under `/usr/local/bin/protoc`.
- `make install_lint`. This will install `golangci-lint` at the version used during Drand's development.
- `make build_proto`. This will compile the project's proto files.

Finally, if you ran all the above commands and `git status` does not report any changes to the repository,
then you are ready to start.

### Development flow

After editing all files required by your change:

- Run all tests using `make test`. This will run both unit and integration tests.
- Check your code coverage using `make coverage`.
- Check that all code still compiles using `make build_all`.
- Test operations still work using the `test/local.sh` script. You can terminate it using the CTRL+C/SIGINT and will clean all spawned processes.

You can also run regression testing, see [the section below](#regression-testing).

### Testing with Docker Compose

To test changes using Docker Compose, navigate to [Docker Readme](test/docker/README.md) and follow the steps described there.

#### Testing with PostgreSQL as database backend

Drand supports PostgreSQL as a database backend for storing beacons.

To check your code against it, run `make test-unit-postgres`.

You can also run the `make demo-postgres` command to launch the scripted demo using
PostgreSQL as a backend.

If you want to run an isolated version of Postgres, you can use the `test/docker-compose.yaml` file
from the root of this repository to do so.

To start the database, use:
```shell
cd test/
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the database, use:
```shell
docker-compose down
```

If you wish to remove the database volume too, use this command instead to stop:
```shell
docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

## Regression testing

To make sure new changes can integrate without issues with the existing deployments,
you can run regression testing.

To do so, run the following commands:
```shell
git checkout master
go build -o drand-existing
git checkout <your-branch>
go build -o drand-candidate
go run ./demo/regression -release ./drand-existing -candidate ./drand-candidate
```

If you want to test your code against the PostgreSQL backend, replace the
`go run` command above with:

```shell
go run ./demo/regression -db=postgres -release ./drand-existing -candidate ./drand-candidate
```
